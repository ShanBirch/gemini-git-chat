## 🌟 Why GitChat AI?

Most AI agents are desktop-bound and heavy. GitChat AI is built for the **"Engineer on the move."** Whether you're at a cafe or on a train, you can perform full-scale repository refactors directly from your mobile browser.

### ✨ Key Features:
- **📱 Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for touch, including Pull-to-Refresh and PWA support.
- **🔋 Screen Wake Lock**: Prevents your phone from sleeping during long AI generations.
- **🤖 Multi-Model Intelligence**: Switch between **Gemini 3.1 Pro**, **DeepSeek V3.2**, and **MiniMax M2.5** (SOTA for agentic coding).
- **🛠️ Direct GitHub Integration**: The AI has its own "hands"—it can list files, read code, and write updates directly to your branches.
- **🔐 Privacy First**: Your API keys never leave your browser. Optional cloud sync is handled via your own Supabase instance.
- **🔗 Zero-Reentry Sync**: Generate a "Sync Permalink" to bookmark your config and never re-enter keys again.

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 Seconds)

1. **Deploy to Netlify**: (Button coming soon) or just host the `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css` on any static host.
2. **Connect GitHub**: Enter your GitHub PAT and select a repository.
3. **Add AI Keys**: Enter your Gemini, DeepSeek, or MiniMax keys in the settings.
